So there’s a new folder I’m checking in to the same tree called task-details, under there there’s task1 and task2. Please ignore task1, we’re working on task2. Under there I’ll have  2 screenshots, one a modification of PlayCardView that you have implemented. The other is a new screen that is very similar to the others, for you to add.
